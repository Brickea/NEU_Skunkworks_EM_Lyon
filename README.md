# NEU Skunkworks EM Lyon Workshop

NEU Skunkworks AI workshop at Northeastern with EM Lyon Business School

## Problem predicting ad lift 
When one serves ads one has a choice of various channels to place ads. For an individual that choice might be to place ads on facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. For large ad companies they place ads with large Digital Service Providers (DSPs) such as Googleâ€™s Walled Garden, Open Web, and others which allow for an ad to be placed across many thousands of digital properties.

The effectiveness of an ad is usually measured through a metric called "lift." As different digital properties have different measures of effectiveness such as views, clicks, likes, shares, etc. and these measures are combined into a single metric, lift, which can be used to estimate the increase in sales over no advertising.

We use historical lift data to predict the lift that occured in the past. 

This workshop has two notebooks:

* Predicting Ad Lift with a Neural Network   

* Predicting Ad Lift with an Ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms

If you run a notebook and it tells you that you are missing a library 

Use pip install or conda install if missing a library


You will need to install H2O.ai Automl for python to run notebook two. 


```bash

pip install requests
pip install tabulate
pip install "colorama>=0.3.8"
pip install future

pip uninstall h2o


pip install -f http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/latest_stable_Py.html h2o

```

Note: When installing H2O from pip in OS X El Capitan, users must include the --user flag.

```bash
pip install -f http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/latest_stable_Py.html h2o --user
```

See Downloading & Installing H2O [http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/downloading.html](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/downloading.html)
