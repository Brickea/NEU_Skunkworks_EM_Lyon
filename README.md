## Problem predicting ad lift 
When one serves ads one has a choice of various channels to place ads. For an individual that choice might be to place ads on facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. For large ad companies they place ads with large Digital Service Providers (DSPs) such as Googleâ€™s Walled Garden, Open Web, and others which allow for an ad to be placed across many thousands of digital properties.

The effectiveness of an ad is usually measured through a metric called "lift." As different digital properties have different measures of effectiveness such as views, clicks, likes, shares, etc. and these measures are combined into a single metric, lift, which can be used to estimate the increase in sales over no advertising.

We use historical lift data to predict the lift that occured in the past. 

This workshop has two notebooks:

* Predicting Ad Lift with a Neural Network   

* Predicting Ad Lift with an Ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms  


Place:

Thursday, Dec 5, from 1 - 3 pm at Snell Library 123 at Northeastern University
